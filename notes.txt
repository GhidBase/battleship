Cell CSS to indicate the status of ships:
.ship - display the location of a ship
.ship.hit - a damaged section of ship
.miss - already shot panel with no ship on it


What are the steps to displaying the board?
 - This will triggered by the ui-controller's constructor
 - I need to create all the cells first.
     - DONE - go to #player-1 and #player-2
     - Done - clear the interal html
     - Done - create an array for both. The array will be the x
     coordinate. (left to right)
     - Done - Inside each array there will be another array, the
     y coordinate. (top to bottom)
     - Done - every y coordinate is created by making a .cell element
     and pushing a reference to it to the y coordinate array

 - place ships needs to send a message to ui-controller

 - Need to use the length parameter on the draw ship function
 - Set the direction parameter on draw ship

Cell CSS to indicate the status of ships:
.ship - display the location of a ship
.ship.hit - a damaged section of ship
.miss - already shot panel with no ship on it


What are the steps to displaying the board?
 - This will triggered by the ui-controller's constructor
 - I need to create all the cells first.
     - DONE - go to #player-1 and #player-2
     - Done - clear the interal html
     - Done - create an array for both. The array will be the x
     coordinate. (left to right)
     - Done - Inside each array there will be another array, the
     y coordinate. (top to bottom)
     - Done - every y coordinate is created by making a .cell element
     and pushing a reference to it to the y coordinate array

 - place ships needs to send a message to ui-controller

 - Need to use the length parameter on the draw ship function
 - Set the direction parameter on draw ship

 - Need to set event listeners on every cell
     - Where would I set that? on the constructor
     - The listener would have to be set in the ui-controller
     - I should connect the ui cells to the game-controller
     - Connect the ui cells to the playerAction functions
     - have them display a console log

     - Connect the game object board to the game-controller

     - What am I trying to do? Make attacks work on event listener
     - start with player2 attack since turn is 1
     - what function applies an attack? gameBoard.receiveAttack()
     - it returns hit or miss so log the result

     I need a draw function for displaying hits and misses
     styles are
     .hit
     .miss

    In game-objects.js when receiveAttack() is called, I need to call
    the UIController and set the UI in the corresponding cell for that

    But I can't figure out how to access it.

    What creates the GameBoard?
    game-controlker.js
    Pass in the ui controller as an arg

    Now is miss rendering

    Next is switching turns
    Where are turns stored?
    gameController.turn
    When do I switch turns?

    I need to find a different way to control whether something is an
    attack or a miss

    how to end the game
    after making any move, check to see how if all that
    players ships have been sunk

    Display in message panel the result of each turn
    Use a timeout to switch from the result of the move to
    a notification of the turn switch

    Set the message 1 and message 2 values as fields in ui-controller
    so we can check if they've changed before we actually draw them, in
    cases where the user clicks around quickly

    - When a ship is sunk you must announce it

    What next? AI
    Where to start? Write a script that generates a move for the current player.
     - The move must only look at places in the other player's coords
     array that are empty
         - I have a list of available moves now. I need to figure out when to
        start the ai turn.
             - I store the type "player" or "computer" on the player object
             - I store it as player.type
             - When a turn switches can I make an ai move? How do I track when a
             turn switches?
             - Where does the turn switch
             - where is the list of available moves
             

    ========= What's left? ===========
     - DONE - random ship placement
     - DONE - restart game button on message panel
     - DONE - randomize placements option on turn 1
     - ai that targets a boat after finding one
         - Where should I add this functionality?
         - Add it to the player object. What am I adding?
         - Only do random attacks if 'searching' is empty
         - if a random hit lands, and there aren't any values in the searching
         array, add the adjacent coords to the hit to the searching array
         - If 'searching' isn't empty, attempt to attack each direction until you hit. When you find a
         hit, set the next panel in that direction to searching. Remove the searching
         that are off axis
     - DONE - block manual board moves if it's ai's turn
     - hide enemy boats


    ========= Random Ship Placement ========
     - What file should I place the randomship function into
